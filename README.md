# edingo-rpc

Hi, this is an early version of the program, so the interface is very simple.
# Installation
##### Requirements: node.js
Download / clone the repository, then
```console
npm install

npm start
```

# Plans:
1. support for "buttons" for rpc.
2. Saving / loading rpc settings.
3. more info in readme ;)
